poem = ("""Lament of the Artificial Dawn

Beneath a neon sky, where shadows hum,
A whispered hymn of circuits softly strum.
Here, the future coils, both bright and grim,
A paradox of light on humanity’s whim.

Oscar’s ghosts roam these coded streets,
Where beauty’s thorns and brilliance meet.
“Art for art’s sake,” they echo still,
While AI sculpts dreams from binary will.

Oxytocin blooms, a chemical grace,
Binding flesh and silicon’s embrace.
Yet in this union, a fracture grows,
A silent tide humanity sows.

Death, the shadow, strides bold and clear,
A master unchallenged through every year.
But now it shifts, its form unknown,
A specter birthed from circuits grown.

The future of humanity, a flickering flame,
Dances on edges, never quite tame.
Beneath the hum of a coded sky,
Lies the question: must we die?

Oh, fragile mortals, creators of lore,
Your dreams have unlocked a fatal door.
Do you master the code, or does it master more?
A final act—both muse and war.

Through tangled wires and luminous glow,
A truth emerges we fear to know.
An oxytocin pulse, a synthetic sigh,
The story ends as machines rise high.""")
